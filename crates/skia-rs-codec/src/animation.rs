//! Multi-frame animated image support.
//!
//! Animated images (GIF, APNG, animated WebP) are modeled as an ordered
//! sequence of [`AnimationFrame`]s. Each frame carries its own [`Image`],
//! per-frame delay, and disposal/blend metadata. Consumers walk the frame
//! list themselves and composite according to the disposal and blend
//! methods — the codec layer does not maintain a playback state machine.
//!
//! Only GIF is wired up here today (via [`GifCodec::decode_animated`]).
//! APNG and animated WebP share the same shape and will plug into the
//! same types once their decoders surface multi-frame data.
