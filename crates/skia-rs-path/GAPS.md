## Critical Gaps

### GAP-C1: PathMeasure (COMPLETE STUB)

**Status:** RESOLVED (Tasks 8-13 - PathMeasure fully implemented with adaptive curve flattening)

**Location:** `src/measure.rs`
**Issue:** Entire module is stubbed -- all methods return `None` or `0.0`
**Description:** PathMeasure provides arc length parameterization for paths, allowing
queries like "give me the point 50% along this path" or "extract a subsegment from
distance A to B". Currently non-functional. The `compute_lengths()` method sets
`total_length` to `0.0` unconditionally, and every query method (`get_point_at`,
`get_tangent_at`, `get_matrix_at`, `get_segment`) returns `None` after a bounds
check against the always-zero total_length (meaning the bounds check itself always
triggers the early return for any positive distance).

**Stubbed functions:**
- `compute_lengths()` - Sets total_length to 0.0, never populates contour_lengths
- `get_point_at(distance)` - Returns None (TODO comment on line 48)
- `get_tangent_at(distance)` - Returns None (TODO comment on line 58)
- `get_matrix_at(distance)` - Returns None (TODO comment on line 68)
- `get_segment(start, end)` - Returns None (TODO comment on line 78)

**Compiler warning:** `field 'path' is never read` on the stored path, confirming
that no method actually accesses the path data.

**Skia reference:**
- `skia/src/core/SkPathMeasure.cpp` (~500 lines)
- `skia/src/core/SkContourMeasure.cpp`
- `skia/src/core/SkGeometry.cpp` (curve evaluation)

**Algorithm required:**
1. Curve flattening: Convert Bezier curves to polylines with adaptive tolerance
2. Length computation: Build cumulative length table per contour
3. Point interpolation: Binary search cumulative table + linear interpolation within segment
4. Tangent calculation: Derivative evaluation at the located parameter
5. Matrix generation: Combine position + tangent into an affine transform
6. Segment extraction: Build new Path from distance range, splitting curves at boundaries

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks (most complex gap in path crate)
**Dependencies:**
- Curve subdivision utilities (de Casteljau splitting at arbitrary t)
- Binary search helpers for cumulative distance table
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks animation, path following, dashed path rendering
**Downstream impact:** `Path1DEffect::apply()` (line 800-839) calls `PathMeasure::new`,
`measure.length()`, `measure.get_point_at()`, and `measure.get_tangent_at()` -- all
of which silently fail, making Path1DEffect non-functional as well.
**Test data:** skia/tests/PathMeasureTest.cpp has reference test cases

---

### GAP-C2: TrimEffect::apply() is a no-op

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 14 - TrimEffect uses PathMeasure::get_segment)

**Location:** `src/effects.rs:594-603`
**Issue:** `TrimEffect::apply()` returns `Some(path.clone())` unconditionally -- it
never trims anything.
**Description:** The comment on line 596-597 acknowledges this: "This is a simplified
implementation / A full implementation would use PathMeasure". Since PathMeasure
itself is stubbed (GAP-C1), the trim effect has no way to compute which portion of
the path to keep. The struct correctly stores `start`, `end`, and `mode` fields, and
validation in `new()` is correct, but `apply()` does no actual work.

**Skia reference:** `skia/src/effects/SkTrimPathEffect.cpp`
**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days (once PathMeasure is implemented)
**Dependencies:** GAP-C1 (PathMeasure)
**Priority:** HIGH - Required for path animation workflows (e.g., drawing-on effects)

---

### GAP-C3: Path1DEffect::apply() silently fails due to PathMeasure stub

**Status:** RESOLVED (auto-fixed by GAP-C1 - Path1DEffect already uses PathMeasure)

**Location:** `src/effects.rs:798-845`
**Issue:** The implementation is structurally correct but non-functional because it
depends on PathMeasure (GAP-C1). `measure.length()` always returns `0.0`, so the
`while distance < length` loop (line 815) never executes, and the function returns
an empty path (Some(builder.build()) with nothing added).

**Estimated effort:** 0 (fix falls out of GAP-C1 implementation)
**Dependencies:** GAP-C1 (PathMeasure)
**Priority:** HIGH - stamps/repeating patterns along a path are a core drawing feature

---

### GAP-C4: Boolean ops `subtract_polygon()` is incomplete

**Status:** RESOLVED (P7A — geo crate sweep-line booleans replace hand-rolled polygon clipping)

**Location (historical):** `src/ops.rs:530-552`
**Issue:** The `subtract_polygon()` function only handled the trivial case where the
clip fully contained the subject (returns empty). For partial overlaps, it returned
the unmodified subject polygon. The comments explicitly acknowledged the limitation.

**Impact:** `PathOp::Difference`, `PathOp::ReverseDifference`, and `PathOp::Xor` all
produced incorrect results when shapes partially overlapped.

**Resolution:** `polygon_difference`, `polygon_union`, `polygon_intersect`, and
`polygon_xor` now delegate to the [`geo`](https://docs.rs/geo) crate's
[`BooleanOps`](https://docs.rs/geo/latest/geo/algorithm/bool_ops/trait.BooleanOps.html)
trait, which implements a robust sweep-line algorithm that correctly handles
partial overlaps, concave inputs, holes, and self-intersecting polygons. The
old `subtract_polygon` and `intersect_convex_polygons` helpers have been
deleted. Regression tests in `ops::tests` exercise the previously-broken cases
(partial-overlap Difference / Xor / ReverseDifference, concave Intersect).

---

### GAP-C5: `intersect_convex_polygons()` only works for convex polygons

**Status:** RESOLVED (P7A — resolved together with GAP-C4 by switching to geo crate)

**Location (historical):** `src/ops.rs:476-528`
**Issue:** The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm only produced correct results when
both input polygons were convex. General paths (circles, bezier shapes, any
concave polygon) produced incorrect intersection results when linearized into
concave polygons.

**Impact:** Any non-trivial `PathOp::Intersect` operation on real-world paths
was incorrect.

**Resolution:** Covered by GAP-C4's fix — `polygon_intersect` now calls
`geo::BooleanOps::intersection` on `MultiPolygon<f64>` representations of the
linearized inputs, which handles concave inputs correctly. The
`intersect_concave_polygons` regression test verifies that a point in an
L-shape's cut-out corner (inside the clip rectangle but outside the concave
subject) is correctly excluded from the result.

---

### GAP-C6: DashEffect does not handle curve segments correctly

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 15 - DashEffect pre-flattens curves to lines)

**Location:** `src/effects.rs:224-260`
**Issue:** When the DashEffect encounters Quad, Conic, or Cubic path elements, it
subdivides them into fixed-step line approximations (8 steps for quads/conics, 12
for cubics) but does NOT apply the dash interval logic to those subdivided segments.
It only checks `if is_on` and draws all subdivision steps when on, skipping all when
off. This means dashes will never start or end in the middle of a curve segment --
the dash state only transitions at Line segment boundaries.

For short line segments the effect is passable, but for long curves a single dash
interval may need to start or stop partway through the curve.

**Skia reference:** `skia/src/effects/SkDashPathEffect.cpp` flattens curves first,
then applies dash logic to the resulting line segments uniformly.

**Estimated effort:** 3-5 days
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Produces visibly incorrect output on curved paths

---

## Nice-to-Have Gaps

### GAP-N1: `Path::tight_bounds()` is identical to `bounds()`

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 7 - tight_bounds uses quad/cubic extrema)

**Location:** `src/path.rs:513-517`
**Issue:** The comment says "For now, same as bounds (which already considers all
points)" but this is incorrect for curves. The tight bounds of a cubic Bezier curve
should be computed from the curve's extrema (roots of the derivative), not from the
control points. Control point bounds are an overestimate.

**Skia reference:** `SkPath::computeTightBounds()` in `skia/src/core/SkPath.cpp`
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days (requires solving quadratic/cubic root finding)
**Priority:** LOW - bounds() is always a valid superset; tight_bounds() is an optimization

---

### GAP-N2: `Path::length()` uses control polygon approximation for curves

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (P7B)

**Location:** `src/path.rs:767-825`
**Issue:** For Quad/Conic curves, length was approximated as
`distance(start, ctrl) + distance(ctrl, end)` which is the control polygon length --
always an overestimate. For Cubic, it used
`distance(start, c1) + distance(c1, c2) + distance(c2, end)`. A more accurate
approach would use adaptive subdivision or Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

**Resolution:** Now uses `flatten_quad_adaptive`, `flatten_cubic_adaptive`, and
`flatten_conic_adaptive` from `flatten.rs` with a tolerance of 0.25 units. Each
curve is subdivided adaptively until the chord-midpoint deviation is below tolerance,
then the arc length is computed by summing the line segment lengths. For a
quarter-circle conic (radius 1, weight sqrt(2)/2), the computed length is within
0.05 of π/2. For a straight-line cubic (all control points collinear), the computed
length matches the chord length rather than the 3x-overestimate control polygon length.

---

### GAP-N3: `Path::contains()` uses fixed-step curve linearization

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (P7B)

**Location:** `src/path.rs:559-643`
**Issue:** Conic containment check (lines 461-476 in old version) ignored the weight parameter,
treating conics as quadratic beziers. The approximation used 8 steps for quads/conics
and 12 for cubics regardless of curve complexity. Adaptive subdivision based on
curvature would be more accurate.

**Resolution:** Now uses `flatten_quad_adaptive`, `flatten_cubic_adaptive`, and
`flatten_conic_adaptive` from `flatten.rs` with a tolerance of 0.1 units. Each
curve is subdivided adaptively, respecting the conic weight parameter, then the
ray-crossing count is computed over the resulting polyline segments. Test case
verifies that a point inside a quarter-circle conic (but outside the control
triangle) is correctly contained, and a point outside the arc is correctly excluded.

---

### GAP-N4: `Path::is_oval()` uses heuristic detection

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 5 - verifies cardinal-point endpoints)

**Location:** `src/path.rs:278-285`
**Issue:** The check only counts verb types (4 cubics or 4 conics + move + close)
without verifying the control points actually form an ellipse. A path with 4 arbitrary
cubic segments and a close verb would incorrectly return `true`.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** LOW - Rarely affects correctness in practice

---

### GAP-N5: `Path::convexity()` does not cache its result

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 6 - cached via AtomicU8)

**Location:** `src/path.rs:288-319`
**Issue:** The method checks `self.convexity != PathConvexity::Unknown` at the start
but never stores the computed result back into `self.convexity`. The struct has the
field, and the method takes `&self` (not `&mut self`), so caching would require
interior mutability (Cell/RefCell) or changing the API. Each call recomputes from
scratch. Also, the convexity check only considers points, not the curve segments
between them.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** LOW

---

### GAP-N6: Conic handling in `ops.rs` ignores weight

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 4 - linearize_conic uses weighted rational form)

**Location:** `src/ops.rs:275-278`
**Issue:** When linearizing conics in `path_to_polygons()`, the weight parameter `w`
is captured but unused (compiler warning: `unused variable: w` on line 275). The conic
is treated as an unweighted quadratic. For weights far from 1.0 (e.g., exact circular
arcs with w = sqrt(2)/2), this produces noticeable geometric error.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** LOW

---

### GAP-N7: `StrokeJoin::Round` in `path_utils.rs` is under-approximated

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 3 - generates arc segments)

**Location:** `src/path_utils.rs:281-284`
**Issue:** The round join implementation uses a single averaged offset point instead of
generating an arc of line segments (as done for round caps on lines 390-406). This
produces a straight-line join rather than a curved one, defeating the purpose of
round joins.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Round joins are visually common

---

### GAP-N8: `stroke_to_fill()` uses last contour's `is_closed` for all contours

**Status:** RESOLVED (Task 2 - is_closed tracked per contour)

**Location:** `src/path_utils.rs:109, 160-166`
**Issue:** The `is_closed` flag is updated in the iteration loop (line 149) but only
the final value is used when stroking all contours (line 165). If a path has multiple
contours with different open/closed states, only the last contour's state applies to
all of them. Each contour should track its own closed state.

**Estimated effort:** 0.5 days
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Bug for multi-contour paths

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Modules with zero tests:
- **path.rs** - 30 public functions, 0 tests. None of the following are tested:
  `bounds()`, `is_rect()`, `is_oval()`, `convexity()`, `direction()`, `reverse()`,
  `transform()`, `contains()`, `length()`, `tight_bounds()`, `iter()`
- **builder.rs** - 24 public functions, 0 tests. None of the builder methods
  (`move_to`, `line_to`, `quad_to`, `cubic_to`, `add_rect`, `add_oval`,
  `add_circle`, `add_round_rect`, `add_arc`, `arc_to`, relative methods, etc.)
  have any tests.
- **measure.rs** - 8 public functions, 0 tests. The entire stub is untested.

### Modules with minimal tests:
- **ops.rs** - 4 tests covering only: empty paths, non-overlapping union,
  non-overlapping intersect, and polygon contains_point. No tests for:
  overlapping operations, difference, xor, reverse-difference, curve linearization,
  or the polygon clipping algorithm.
- **effects.rs** - 6 tests covering only: DashEffect construction, odd interval
  doubling, CornerEffect construction, DiscreteEffect construction, make_*
  convenience functions, and compose effect. No tests for: `apply()` on any effect,
  TrimEffect, SumEffect, Path1DEffect, Path2DEffect, Line2DEffect, or actual
  path transformation correctness.
- **svg.rs** - 5 tests covering: simple M/L/Z, relative commands, C curves, arcs,
  H/V lines. No tests for: S (smooth cubic), T (smooth quad), error cases
  (malformed input, missing moveto, invalid numbers), edge cases (empty string,
  only whitespace, repeated commands).
- **path_utils.rs** - 3 tests: stroke_to_fill with a line, stroke_to_fill with
  a triangle, and StrokeParams builder. No tests for: round caps, square caps,
  miter limit fallback to bevel, curves in stroke input, multi-contour strokes.

### Estimated test coverage by function count:
- Functions with at least one test: ~15 / 106 (~14%)
- Functions with no test coverage: ~91 / 106 (~86%)

## Implementation Notes

### Unused dependencies
The `Cargo.toml` declares `thiserror`, `arrayvec`, and `proptest` (dev) as
dependencies but none are used in any source file. `serde` is feature-gated but
also unused. These should be cleaned up.

### Compiler warnings
The crate produces 4 warnings:
1. `unused import: Verb` in ops.rs:6
2. `variable does not need to be mutable` in effects.rs:142 (`interval_offset`)
3. `unused variable: w` in ops.rs:275 (conic weight -- see GAP-N6)
4. `field 'path' is never read` in measure.rs:9 (confirms PathMeasure stub)

### Cascade effect from PathMeasure stub
PathMeasure (GAP-C1) has been implemented. The previously blocked
downstream effects are now live:
- `TrimEffect::apply()` (GAP-C2) — uses `PathMeasure::get_segment`.
- `Path1DEffect::apply()` (GAP-C3) — iterates along the measured path.
- Path-animation / path-following APIs can now be built on top.

### Pattern: Fixed-step curve approximation
Multiple modules approximate curves with fixed subdivision steps (8 for quads, 12
for cubics) rather than adaptive flattening. This appears in: `path.rs` (contains),
`effects.rs` (DashEffect, DiscreteEffect for curves), `path_utils.rs` (flatten_quad,
flatten_cubic). The `ops.rs` module is the exception -- it uses adaptive tolerance-
based subdivision via `linearize_quad()` and `linearize_cubic()`. Unifying on
adaptive flattening across all modules would improve both accuracy and performance.

### Boolean ops architectural limitation
The current boolean ops implementation converts all paths to polygons, then operates
on the polygon level using simple containment checks and Sutherland-Hodgman clipping.
This approach fundamentally cannot handle concave polygons or partial overlaps
correctly. A production-quality implementation would need either:
- Weiler-Atherton algorithm for polygon clipping
- A sweep-line approach (Bentley-Ottmann) for robust intersection finding
- Or wrapping an existing robust library (e.g., `geo` crate with `BoolOps` trait)

## Recommendations

1. ~~**Implement PathMeasure**~~ — **Done.** `PathMeasure` uses adaptive
   flattening and is consumed by `TrimEffect`, `Path1DEffect`,
   `Path::length`, and `Path::contains`.

2. ~~**Fix TrimEffect**~~ — **Done.** Resolved alongside GAP-C1.

3. **Fix DashEffect curve handling** (GAP-C6, 3-5 days) -- Flatten curves to lines
   before applying dash logic, matching Skia's approach.

4. **Fix stroke_to_fill multi-contour bug** (GAP-N8, 0.5 days) -- Track is_closed
   per contour. Quick correctness fix.

5. **Fix round join approximation** (GAP-N7, 1 day) -- Generate arc segments for
   round joins to match the round cap implementation.

6. ~~**Improve boolean ops** (GAP-C4/C5, 2-3 weeks minimum)~~ -- **Done in P7A.**
   The `geo` crate's `BooleanOps` trait now backs `polygon_union`,
   `polygon_intersect`, `polygon_difference`, and `polygon_xor`. Evaluated and
   adopted the existing library over reimplementing Bentley-Ottmann from
   scratch.

7. **Add comprehensive tests** (~2 weeks) -- Current 14% test coverage is far below
   what is needed for a geometry library. Prioritize:
   - PathMeasure (as part of implementation)
   - Boolean ops correctness (overlapping shapes)
   - SVG parsing error cases
   - Path containment for all fill types
   - DashEffect on curved paths

8. **Clean up unused dependencies** (0.5 days) -- Remove thiserror, arrayvec from
   Cargo.toml; add proptest-based fuzz tests or remove proptest.

9. **Fix compiler warnings** (0.5 days) -- Address all 4 existing warnings.

10. **Unify curve flattening** (1-2 days) -- Extract the adaptive tolerance-based
    linearization from `ops.rs` into a shared utility and use it everywhere.
